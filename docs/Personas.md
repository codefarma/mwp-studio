Edwin the Engineer
------------------
Edwin knows how to program in 5 different languages. Java, PHP, Python, Javascript, and Ruby. He mainly works in PHP
now since he has started working for a design shop that deals heavily in Wordpress sites and WooCommerce store builds.
He started programming in Python and Java when he was in school, and then moved on to Ruby for some of his side projects.
He became proficient in Javascript while developing for the client side of his open source web analytics platform. 

On tuesdays, Edwin plays basketball at a local gym with his buddies after getting home from work. He was all state guard in
high school and has really been nailing it lately with his jump shots. His friend James is always giving him a hard time for
wearing old school converse shoes, but he has fond memories of shooting hoops with his dad when he was young, and his dad
used to rock the converse.

He's worked for 5 different corporate outfits in the last 10 years, and has built everything from mobile apps on Android, 
to backend API's for startup companies, and web applications for brick and mortar enterprises that required a high degree
of communication between departments.

His first introduction to PHP was with his last job, where he needed to maintain and optimize a subset of code that ran the
internal company ERP platform. His pre-disposition to PHP was that it was a sloppy language that required you to write sloppy 
code, and he wasn't too enthusiastic about the thought of having to work with it. He soon began to gain some respect for it
as the ERP platform code he was working with was actually fairly elegantly written and well documented.

Then he moved jobs once again to work for his current employer, Digital Emporium, who provides custom plugin development
solutions for a wide client base of customers using the Wordpress platform. After troubleshooting a handful of client issues
that were caused by 3rd party plugins that they were using, he is now once again convinced that PHP is a sloppy language and
everybody who programs with it is a demon with a keyboard.

Darian the Developer
--------------------
Darian recently graduated from a local university with a computer science degree. Most of his experience building software
is limited to school projects and some personal projects that he worked on while he was in high school. After graduating,
he accepted a job with ShopConnect, a company providing turn key ecommerce store rollouts for franchises that want to do
business online. The platform of choice is Wordpress/Woocommerce, which is familiar to him because he used Wordpress to
build his personal blog a few years back.

When he was in high school, he hiked to the top of mount...

Thomas the Designer
-------------------
Thomas loves to sketch things out on paper and create new designs that capture his mood. He decided to go to a web design 
boot camp to learn how to program websites, and found that the design aspect of the process was the most appealing to him.
He loves to create layouts and themes that make him feel good, and decided to make a business of it so he can live the 
dream of working for himself. He decided that Wordpress was the platform he would design his themes for since his research
revealed that it has the largest market and the best potential for him to earn a profit.

In his spare time, Thomas...

Marvin the Manager
------------------
Marvin was an engineer for 8 years, and was in sales for another 5. Two of those 5 years in sales were as a sales manager,
which he truly enjoyed because of the people he was managing. However, he wasn't too keen on the long hours on the road and
the unpredicatable nature of an income based on sales commissions. When he was presented the opportunity to move back into 
the engineering department of his company, SoftWorks Inc., as a DevOps Manager, he obliged.

SoftWorks is a solution provider that deals mainly with...
