Personas
========

Darian the Developer
--------------------
Darian is a university graduate with a computer science degree. Most of his early experience coding came from school
projects, with a small amount being attributed to customizing the Wordpress site for his high school band. He earned
the directors award for outstanding performance his senior year.

Darian currently works for ShopConnect, a company providing turn key ecommerce solutions for franchisees that also do
business online. His biggest client is a chain of pet accessory retail stores that all run on WooCommerce. As a new
developer, he is most excited to learn how to build software from the ground up. His company has developed and maintains
8 different commercial Wordpress plugin offerings.

### Problem Scenarios

* Bootstrapping New Plugins
  - Starting a plugin without an existing framework is difficult
  - Starting a plugin by copying a framework is a chore
  - Choosing a solid architecture for a new plugin is difficult
  - Copying code from previous projects leads to cruft and bugs
  
* Developing using Modern Design Patterns
  - Wordpress lacks any fundamental OOP architecture
  - Implementing modern design patterns is cumbersome 
  - Using code samples found online leads to technical debt
  
* Inspecting/Understanding Call Stacks
  - Finding all actors on filters/hooks is a chore
  - Visualizing the heirarchy of hook stack execution is difficult
  - Discovering code based bottlenecks is time consuming
  
* Grouping Code Change Commits
  - On the fly refactors and fixes lead to unclear/muddy code commits
  
* Implementing WP Code Patterns
  - Naive solutions often lead to incompatibilities and bypassed subsystems
  - Naive solutions often lead to security vulnerabilities

Edwin the Engineer
------------------
Edwin works for a 20 person IT development company. A typical project for them involves 3-5 people working on a 
project and typically lasts 6-12 months, though they're sometimes called upon to squeeze in a quick (1 month) project 
and they also have some long term customers for which they maintain apps that they've built in the past.

Edwin enjoys flying his Phantom 4 drone on the weekends and moonlights as an amateur photographer. He's outfitted his
drone with a few extra upgrades that gives it extra flight time. His girlfriend jokes about him not being able to fly
it straight while in sport mode.

Most of the dev work he has done in the past has been ASP/Java based on corporate networks. But recently, his company has
shifted into the world of web application development, with a significant amount of work coming from clients with 
websites running on LAMP stacks that need custom development work. 1 out of 3 new clients require custom Wordpress
development.

### Problem Scenarios

* Analyzing Code Performance Issues
* Troubleshooting Inter-plugin Compatibility Bugs
* Auditing For Security Vulnerabilities
* Testing Coverage

Andrew the Architect
-------------------
Andrew enjoys contemplating the big picture and solving problems abstractly. Whenever he is presented with a problem,
he wants to find a solution that can be re-used and applied in many different capacities. When he began working for
his current company, the first thing he did was to create and document a set of development tools that could be used
within his team to streamline new projects.

As a middle aged adult, Andrew has been finding it a bit tougher to stay fit. He enjoys being outdoors and boating,
and has recently started a new diet challenge in hopes of gaining back some of his youthfulness.

His next big project at work will be to help his company launch a new software product in the web application domain
built on the Wordpress platform that will position his team in the forefront of the industry and allow the company to
expand even further.

### Problem Scenarios

* Designing Data Models
* Leveraging MVC & MVVM
* Managing Database Schemas
* Managing Compatibility Tradeoffs
* Communicating Architecture
* Communicating Standards

Thomas the Designer
-------------------
Thomas is the lead designer at a contract web development firm in San Jose. He has a degree in graphic design and divides 
his time between Photoshop/Illustrator and HTML/CSS. Lately, he has been learning to code his HTML/CSS designs as Wordpress
themes since a majority of the clients he works for have sites built on Wordpress.  

George works on a Mac exclusively. On his way into the office, he grabs coffee from the barista next to his apartment. He 
enjoys the fact that he only has a 20 minute commute each way.

### Problem Scenarios

* Bootstrapping New Themes
* Refactoring HTML Structures
* Finding Proper Hook Points
  - Finding where certain output is being generated from is challenging
* Implementing WP Code Patterns
  - Implementing solutions for basic problems impedes the creative process

Marvin the Manager
------------------
Marvin manages a team of 6 developers in house, and another 3-5 at any given time as outsourced work.

### Problem Scenarios

* Code Quality Review Processes
* Product Lifecycle Management
* Product Distribution Management

Samuel the Site Owner
---------------------
Samuel runs the most popular site for São Paulo’s music scene and nightlife. If there’s music playing anywhere in São Paulo, 
Samuel's site has got the scoop. It has an events calendar, photo galleries, videos and a blog with articles and interviews.

Samuel uses a Windows computer exclusively.

Through the years of running his site, Samuel has learned how to bend WordPress to do what he wants. He has had outside help 
with the graphic design, but he has done everything else himself, relying heavily on WordPress and jQuery plugins to get the 
desired effect.

Gabriel’s site already has a mobile presentation, but he knows that many people rely on mobile apps rather than the browser. 
He would like to have an app that lets people submit photos, can receive push notifications about big events and can have a 
snappier, more responsive feel than his mobile website. 

### Problem Scenarios

* Optimizing Performance
* Customizing Functionality

Steven the Support Agent
------------------------
### Problem Scenarios

* Remote Diagnostics
* Remote Monitoring
