Personas
========
Rhonda (Freelance Developer)
----------------------------
Rhonda is a self taught programmer. She lives in New York and works mostly in PHP. She began offering contract services
working on Wordpress sites after learning how to program her own site. She does a bit of plugin customizations, theme
customizations, and has even built a plugin that she has uploaded to the Wordpress directory. She is proud that it has
400+ active installs.

She lives in a studio apartment with her small dog Rocket. He is an australian terrier with a big attitude. Since she
works from home, Rocket loves to camp out at the edge of the couch right next to Rhonda's workstation and wait for her
to get up so he can entice her to play with him.

Rhonda loves the fact that she makes her own hours, and she has been able to secure a few deals with clients that 
ensures that she stays busy for at least 25-30 hours a week. She usually works another 10-20 additional hours each
week on odd jobs from client referrals and leads she generates from her Wordpress plugin.


Darian (Junior Developer)
-------------------------
Darian is a university graduate with a computer science degree. Most of his early experience programming was in python
while working on school projects, with some exposure to PHP since he maintained his school band website which was built
with Wordpress. 

He can play the guitar, drums, tuba, and clarinet. His favorite instrument is the guitar, although he is planning on 
adding the saxaphone to his repertoire if he can find the time. He earned the directors award for outstanding performance 
3 out of his 4 high school years.

Darian currently works for ShopConnect, a company providing turn key ecommerce solutions for franchisees that also do
business online. His biggest client is a chain of pet accessory retail stores that all run on WooCommerce. As a new
developer, he is most excited to learn how to build software from the ground up. His company has developed and maintains
8 different commercial WooCommerce plugins.

### Problem Scenarios

* Bootstrapping New Plugins
  - Starting a plugin without an existing framework is difficult
  - Starting a plugin by copying a framework is a chore
  - Choosing a solid architecture for a new plugin is difficult
  - Copying code from previous projects leads to cruft and bugs
  
* Developing using Modern Design Patterns
  - Wordpress lacks any fundamental OOP architecture
  - Implementing modern design patterns is cumbersome 
  - Using code samples found online leads to technical debt
  
* Inspecting/Understanding Call Stacks
  - Finding all actors on filters/hooks is a chore
  - Visualizing the heirarchy of hook stack execution is difficult
  - Discovering code based bottlenecks is time consuming
  
* Grouping Code Change Commits
  - On the fly refactors and fixes lead to unclear/muddy code commits
  
* Implementing WP Code Patterns
  - Naive solutions often lead to incompatibilities and bypassed subsystems
  - Naive solutions often lead to security vulnerabilities

Edwin (Senior IT Developer)
------------------------
Edwin works for a 20 person IT development company. A typical project for them involves 3-5 people working on a 
project and typically lasts 6-12 months, though they're sometimes called upon to squeeze in a quick (1 month) project 
and they also have some long term customers for which they maintain apps that they've built in the past.

Edwin enjoys flying his Phantom 4 drone on the weekends and moonlights as an amateur photographer. He's outfitted his
drone with a few extra upgrades that gives it extra flight time. His girlfriend jokes about him not being able to fly
it straight even though it has auto pilot.

Most of the dev work he has done in the past has been ASP/Java based on corporate networks. But recently, his company has
shifted into the world of web application development, with a significant amount of work coming from clients with 
websites running on LAMP stacks that need custom development work. 1 out of 3 new clients require custom Wordpress
development.

### Problem Scenarios

* Analyzing Code Performance Issues
  - Finding/optimizing slow hooks/filters is difficult
  - Finding/optimizing slow database queries is boring
* Troubleshooting Inter-plugin Compatibility Bugs
  - Finding bugs caused by interactions between plugins
* Auditing For Security Vulnerabilities
  - Finding instances of outputting unsanitized user input
* Testing Coverage
  - Bootstrapping tests
  - Writing tests

Andrew (Senior Software Engineer)
----------------------------------
Andrew enjoys contemplating the big picture and solving problems abstractly. Whenever he is presented with a problem,
he wants to find a solution that can be re-used and applied in as many situations as possible. This is a result of his
15 years of experience developing software. When he began working for his current employer, one of the first things he 
did was to create and document a set of new development tools to help his team function at a higher level.

Andrew is pushing 40 years old, and as a middle aged adult, he is finding it tougher to stay fit. He enjoys being outdoors 
and boating, and has recently started a new diet challenge in hopes of gaining back some of his youthfulness.

He is currently working on a new project at work with the goal of positioning his company as a major player and solution
provider in a growing market of Wordpress developers. The plan is to architect an extensible development tool that runs
on Wordpress itself, and that can support a scaling up of add-ons to it as the product matures.

### Problem Scenarios

* Designing Data Models
  - Correctly modeling data with object patterns is a repetitive and time consuming chore
  - Maintaining consistency between multiple developers in a team requires a lot of auxilary effort
* Leveraging MVC & MVVM
  - Scaffolding a new template system for each new project is laborious and wasteful
  - Creating scalable architectures that can be maintained over many cycles is very difficult
* Managing Database Schemas
  - Writing sql scripts to manage database table versions is a pain
  - Keeping multiple development environments in sync with schema changes is challenging
* Managing Compatibility Tradeoffs
  - Keeping on top of compatibility and deprecation issues for new and existing code is tedious

Thomas (Graphic Designer)
-------------------------
Thomas is the lead designer at a contract web development firm in San Jose. He has a degree in graphic design and divides 
his time between Photoshop/Illustrator and HTML/CSS. Lately, he has been learning to code his HTML/CSS designs as Wordpress
themes since a majority of the clients he works for have sites built on Wordpress.  

George works on a Mac exclusively. On his way into the office, he grabs coffee from the barista next to his apartment. He 
enjoys the fact that he only has a 20 minute commute each way.

### Problem Scenarios

* Bootstrapping New Themes
  - Creating and customizing new theme scaffolding is a barrier to creativity
* Refactoring HTML Structures
* Finding Proper Hook Points
  - Finding where certain output is being generated from is challenging
* Implementing WP Code Patterns
  - Implementing solutions for basic problems impedes the creative process

Marvin (Project Owner/Team Lead)
--------------------------------
Marvin manages a team of 6 developers in house, and another 3-5 at any given time as outsourced contractors. He used to
be a full time software developer, but most of his time is now dedicated to managing agile design sprints and developing
user stories through direct communication with users, stakeholders, and the sales team.

His favorite color is blue. His favorite drink is tequila. Sometimes when the team goes out to lunch together, he likes
to order a blue curacao if they eat at the taqueria across the street from the office. He's very happy that his team 
gets along so well and is proud of the culture they have.

### Problem Scenarios

* Code Quality Review Processes
  - Understanding the full range of code in a project requires constant review
  - Common mistakes made by junior devs costs additional time in reviews and refactorings
* Product Lifecycle Management
  - Product versioning and build management is a bane
* Product Distribution Management
  - Distributing premium products and keeping clients up to date is chalk full of obstacles

Samuel (Site Operator)
---------------------
Samuel runs the most popular site for São Paulo’s music scene and nightlife. If there’s music playing anywhere in São Paulo, 
Samuel's site has got the scoop. It has an events calendar, photo galleries, videos and a blog with articles and interviews.

Samuel uses a Windows computer exclusively.

Through the years of running his site, Samuel has learned how to bend WordPress to do what he wants. He has had outside help 
with the graphic design, but he has done everything else himself, relying heavily on WordPress and jQuery plugins to get the 
desired effect.

Gabriel’s site already has a mobile presentation, but he knows that many people rely on mobile apps rather than the browser. 
He would like to have an app that lets people submit photos, can receive push notifications about big events and can have a 
snappier, more responsive feel than his mobile website. 

### Problem Scenarios

* Optimizing Performance
  - Understanding which plugins are responsible for speed bottlenecks is next to impossible
* Customizing Functionality
  - Finding quick solutions to simple problems is never quick
